# work-day-scheduler

## Function
For this project, I made a calendar application that allows the user to save events and todo items for each hour of the day. This app runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery. The current day is listed at the top of the page. There is one row for each hour of the work day that changes colors depending on if they represent past, future, or present times. There are 3 columns in each row, one lists the time, one allows the user to type their events and to-do items, and one is a save button that saves the users input onto the page.

## Skills
This assignment shows aptitude in understanding of the DOM, if/else statements, functions, adding to and pulling from local storage, buttons, and API's.
